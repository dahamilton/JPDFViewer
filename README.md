JPDF Viewer is a Joystick driven PDF Viewer. 

Currently, the project is *very* early alpha. Joystick support is hard-coded to support the two types of Joysticks I ownn.

I am a developer, but I'm not a .NET developer (and it shows!). This was built primarily for my own person use and it's sufficent for that.
I'm sharing it incase someone else might find it useful.
